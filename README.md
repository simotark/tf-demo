Demo Terraform in Azure

Preflight: 
- [x] Check terraform version 
- [x] Check az cli version 
- [x] Check Azure credentials
- [x] Create some initial files

Questions:
- [ ] How does Terraform authenticate to Azure?
- [ ] Do I need to keep secrets in Git? If so, how?
- [ ] 

Other stuff: 
`Set-Alias -Name tf -Value terraform.exe` for some convenience after adding terraform to path. (Actually, you could probably just add the full path here.)
