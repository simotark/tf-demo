Demo Terraform in Azure
Changes in testing are automatically merged to main as long as they pass terraform validation

Ideas:
- Statefile and other files in-depth
- Modules
- Practical example
    - Make a small environment
- QA and testing
    - Add to Actions
- Terragrunt and other extensions
    - probably related to QA stuff
- Secret management
