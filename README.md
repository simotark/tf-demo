Demo Terraform in Azure

Preflight: 
- [x] Check terraform version 
- [x] Check az cli version 
- [x] Check Azure credentials
- [x] Create some initial files

Questions:
- [x] How does Terraform authenticate to Azure?
        Az login
- [ ] Do I need to keep secrets in Git? If so, how?
        - Gitignore hides some, does it cover everything?
- [ ] 

Done: 
- Tested basic functions

To-Do: 
- [ ] Gitignore
- [ ] variables

Other stuff: 
`Set-Alias -Name tf -Value terraform.exe` for some convenience after adding terraform to path. (Actually, you could probably just add the full path here.)
